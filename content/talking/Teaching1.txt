 I've been interested in teaching since I was about seven years old, which means I've spent most of my life obsessing about what makes a teacher a good teacher, what makes a teacher a bad teacher, and what makes an explanation about how to engage with people. So I took up debating, theatre, and I spent a lot of time on verbal communication, how to talk to people, how to figure out what's inside their head, what's inside your head, and how to get those two things to build together. I've also gone through formal teacher training, and I have been a teacher and a tutor for some years now. This does actually translate to the wider world, because it means that my communication skills are far above that of an average computer programmer. I can think in terms of machine code, I can think in terms of the heavily autistic mathematician that I am, but I can also sit and talk to stakeholders with a relaxed calmness that shows a confident understanding of what they need, what I want, and sort of how we can bend those two things together. I can't correct what I want to do. I can't do. I can't do. I can't do. I can't do. This means that I'm able to sort of lead meetings, as I've done, and sort of figure out compromises and where people can and can't sort of put an effort where talent's best allocated, etc. I can't do that. I can't do that.
