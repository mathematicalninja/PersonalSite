 Most people don't like talking about it, but I am disabled. As my partner puts it out, I'm part-time disabled. This means that some days I appear perfectly normal to people. Other days, I'm an invalid. I can't walk, and I'm stuck in a wheelchair, if I can move at all. The root cause of this disability is extreme pain in my spine. And when I say extreme, I do mean it. I have had broken bones that hurt less than my day-to-day life. When I say my pain is a 7, that was as bad as when my partner was having a massive life-threatening surgery, and they spent two months bedridden recovering. So, to me, living in pain is just part of normal. And this is something that most people don't understand and don't know how to deal with. And as such, I don't expect people to understand it. I don't expect them to deal with it. What I expect is that people listen to what I say, respect it, and actually understand that I know what I'm talking about. I know best. I've been seeing doctors for 20 years. You have not thought of some magic solution I haven't thought of. Because I've talked to the doctors. I've gone through the physio. I have done every single thing that is possible. I have to accept that this is just the rest of my life. Some days are better. Some days are worse. But what you find when working with me is that even when I'm off my game, I'm still a brilliant and intelligent person who works hard. When I'm at my best, I'm unstoppable.
